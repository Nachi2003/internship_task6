# Task 6: Password Strength Activity

**Objective:**
Understand what makes a password strong, test different examples using online tools, and learn how complexity improves security. <br>

**Steps Followed:**

1. Created multiple passwords with different levels of complexity. <br>
2. Tested them on **passwordmeter.com**. <br>
3. Compared scores and feedback. <br>
4. Researched how hackers attack passwords. <br>
5. Wrote down best practices for strong passwords. <br>

**Passwords Tested:**

* `abcd1234` → Weak <br>
* `Abcd@123` → Medium <br>
* `AbcD@2025!` → Strong <br>
* `S3cUr3!Pa$$w0rD2025` → Very Strong <br>
* `Qw!9rT#zL@7yP$2uB*5` → Extremely Strong <br>

**Key Learnings:**

* Longer passwords are stronger (12+ characters recommended). <br>
* Use a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols. <br>
* Avoid common words and patterns. <br>
* Randomness makes passwords harder to guess. <br>
* Passphrases (random words combined) are strong and easy to remember. <br>

**Password Attack Methods:**

* **Brute Force**: Tries all combinations – defeated by long and complex passwords. <br>
* **Dictionary Attack**: Uses common words – randomness prevents this. <br>
* **Hybrid Attack**: Mix of dictionary + variations – strong unique passwords resist this. <br>

**Conclusion:**
A strong password is long, complex, random, and unique. Using a password manager or memorable passphrases helps balance security with usability. <br>
